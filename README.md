# Period Tracker

Period tracker is a program designed to be able to use previous data to predict upcoming period cycles. 

Do note, this is my first time doing something like this using actual data, so it will not be accurate, and will continue to be a work in progress.

# How it works
Like the name suggests, the purpose of this program is to track menstural cycles, use previous data, and make predictions about when the next one should occur, in an attempt to give the user a heads up. 

Using it just requires interacting with the menu, and letting it know when the user have their cycles, so the program can then take in that data, analyze it, find patterns, and make predictions.
